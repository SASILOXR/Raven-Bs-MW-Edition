# Raven bS

Raven B4, but for those who can't afford it, or too paranoid to get it. We highly value our user's privacy.

Quality features like AntiFireball, ItemESP, and more. No Bloat, no junk, based off b3, with the help of b4 src.

I wanted to fork the original repository, but the original repository was closed BTW

MW Edition add features like MWItemESP, ShowBarrier, BetterXray and more.

Also imporved some moduless like AimAssist, MoveFix

It can bypass prediciton in 1.8 as long as you configure it correctly
