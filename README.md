# Raven bS MW Edition

Raven B4, but for those who can't afford it, or too paranoid to get it. We highly value our user's privacy.

Quality features like AntiFireball, ItemESP, and more. No Bloat, no junk, based off b3, with the help of b4 src.

I wanted to fork the original repository, but the original repository was closed BTW

MW Edition add features like MWItemESP, ShowBarrier, BetterXray and more.

Also imporved some modules like AimAssist, MoveFix(only fix KillAura and AimAssist)

This client only used on legit

if u get banned, u should care for ur config and don't use blatant module

# Building

When you import your project into IntelliJ, you need to set the gradle jvm to the Java 17 JDK or higher in the gradle tab, and the Project SDK to the Java 1.8 JDK

If you want the ghosthand feature, there is a mod that provides it.
